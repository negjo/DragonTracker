# DragonTracker
ChatTriggers module for Hypixel Skyblock dragons

## Setup
### Import
You can import the module directly through ChatTriggers using */ct import DragonTracker* command while in game. For more information check https://www.chattriggers.com/modules/v/DragonTracker. ChatTriggers will also handle automatic updates, so you don't have to worry about that.
### Manual download
You can also manually download a zip file from the releases and unzip it into your *.minecraft\config\ChatTriggers\modules* folder. This can get you access to new releases faster, but needs to be done manually.

## Usage
- /dragontracker or /dt to open the config menu
- The name of the item has to render for the tracker to detect it, so you need to come relatively close to the drop. Basically when the title and chat messages appear, then the item was tracked.

## Features

- Track total amount of dragons done and eyes placed
- Track how many dragons you did since your last pet and sup
- Track all the loot recieved from the dragons
- Show history of last couple dragons (similar to SBA)
- Track how many dragons of each type you got
- The information shown in the tracker is highly customizable
- Show the loot you got as a title
- Announce your loot in party chat
- Warn you when using wrong pet
